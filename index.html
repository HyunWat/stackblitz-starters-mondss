    <ul>

    <li>Koala </li>

    <h4>
    <p>!!! When choosing a favourite animal, people tend to decide by attractivess, however I base mines through experience and symbolization. </p> </h4>
      Pandas are cultural animals in China; thus marking its importance. Red Pandas specifically, are not just adorable but innocent. To be frank, Red Pandas are also highly skilled; despite its cute appearance. Don't underistimate its physique.

    <p> Koalas are a different story. They benefit society by maintaining the eucalyptus forests. They keep it clean and fresh. Koalas contribution to global warming guides me to be in complete admiration. If not Koalas, then who?
      <p> Lastly, Cockroaches are generally just cool.
<ul>
  <p title>[Honorable Mentions/P.S. I like both.]
  <li>Dogs</li>
  <li>Cats</li>
